# G-Memory Rule Generation Timing and Stopping Conditions



## When Rules Get Created

### 1. Initial Rule Generation Trigger

Rules are first created when the system reaches a minimum threshold of completed tasks:

```python
# From add_memory() function (lines 107-108)
if self.memory_size >= self._start_insights_threshold and self.memory_size % self._rounds_per_insights == 0:
    self.insights_layer.finetune_insights(self._insights_point_num)
```

**Default Configuration:**
- `_start_insights_threshold`: 5 tasks (minimum before generating insights)
- `_rounds_per_insights`: 5 tasks (frequency of generation)
- `_insights_point_num`: 5 points (number of insight points per generation)

**Timeline for HotpotQA Scenario:**
- **Task 5**: First rule generation triggered
- **Task 10**: Second rule generation
- **Task 15**: Third rule generation  
- **Task 20**: Fourth rule generation
- **Task 25**: Fifth rule generation
- And so on...

### 2. Continuous Generation Pattern

After the initial threshold, the system generates rules **every 5 tasks** by default. For the HotpotQA case with 20 rules:

**Estimated Generation Cycles:**
- Approximately 8 generation cycles needed (20 rules ÷ ~2.5 rules per cycle)
- Total tasks processed: 40+ tasks minimum
- Generation frequency: Every 5th task

### 3. Two-Phase Rule Creation Process

Each generation cycle creates rules through:

**Phase 1: Comparative Analysis**
- Compares successful vs failed trajectories
- Identifies what leads to different outcomes
- Creates rules like: "Do X, because Y prevents failure"

**Phase 2: Success Pattern Analysis**  
- Analyzes multiple successful trajectories together
- Finds common success patterns
- Creates rules like: "Use strategy X, because it consistently works"

## When G-Memory STOPS Generating Rules

### The Truth: It Never Completely Stops

G-Memory is designed as a **continuous learning system** that never fully stops generating rules. 
  However, it has several **limiting and balancing mechanisms**:

### 1. Memory Limit Enforcement

```python
# From _update_rules() function (line 850)
list_full: bool = len(self.insights_memory) >= max_rules_num  # Default: MAX_RULE_THRESHOLD = 10
```

**When Memory is Full:**
- **Stronger removal penalties**: REMOVE operations get -3 score instead of -1
- **Preference for modification**: System favors editing existing rules over creating new ones
- **Automatic cleanup**: Low-scoring rules get removed more aggressively

### 2. Rule Merging Every 20 Tasks

```python
# From add_memory() function (lines 109-110)
if self.memory_size % 20 == 0: 
    self.insights_layer.merge_insights()
```

**Merging Process:**
1. **Sort rules by score** (highest first)
2. **Take top rules** up to memory limit
3. **Use LLM to consolidate** similar rules
4. **Replace old rules** with merged versions

**Effect on Rule Count:**
- Usually **reduces** total number of rules
- **Improves** rule quality through consolidation
- **Prevents** memory from growing indefinitely

### 3. Automatic Rule Cleanup

```python
# From clear_insights() function
def clear_insights(self):
    self.insights_memory = [insight for insight in self.insights_memory if insight['score'] > 0]
```

**Rules Get Removed When:**
- Score drops to 0 or below (due to negative correlation with failed tasks)
- They consistently prove unhelpful
- They become redundant after merging

### 4. Adaptive Rule Operations

As the system matures, it shifts from creating new rules to refining existing ones:

**Early Stage (Tasks 1-20):**
- High proportion of ADD operations
- Rapid rule accumulation
- Exploration of different strategies

**Mature Stage (Tasks 50+):**
- More EDIT, AGREE, REMOVE operations
- Focus on rule refinement
- Optimization of existing insights

## Why HotpotQA Got 20 Rules Despite 10-Rule Limit

The HotpotQA scenario with 20 rules is interesting because it exceeds the default limit. Here are the most likely explanations:

### 1. Modified Configuration

The experiment likely used a higher memory limit:

```python
# Possible configuration for HotpotQA
MAX_RULE_THRESHOLD = 20  # Instead of default 10
_start_insights_threshold = 5
_rounds_per_insights = 3  # More frequent generation
```

### 2. Pre-Merge Snapshot

The 20 rules might have been counted **before** a merging cycle:

**Timeline Example:**
- Tasks 1-19: Accumulated 20 rules
- Task 20: Merge cycle would reduce to ~12-15 rules
- **Snapshot taken at Task 19**: Shows 20 rules

### 3. High-Quality Rule Environment

All 20 rules maintained positive scores, indicating:
- **Rich learning environment**: HotpotQA provides diverse patterns
- **Effective rule extraction**: System found many valid insights
- **Low redundancy**: Rules were sufficiently different to avoid merging

### 4. Multiple Rule Categories

The 20 rules likely covered different aspects:
- **Question decomposition strategies**: How to break down complex questions
- **Information retrieval patterns**: Effective search strategies
- **Reasoning approaches**: Logic and inference techniques
- **Error avoidance rules**: Common pitfalls to avoid

## Expected Steady-State Behavior

In a typical long-running scenario, G-Memory follows this pattern:

### Dynamic Equilibrium Around Memory Limit

```
Tasks 1-5:    0 rules (below threshold)
Tasks 5-20:   Growing to ~10 rules (rapid learning)
Task 20:      Merge cycle → ~7-8 rules (consolidation)
Tasks 21-40:  Back to ~10 rules (continued learning)
Task 40:      Merge cycle → ~8-9 rules (refinement)
Tasks 41-60:  Stable ~9-10 rules (optimization)
Task 60:      Merge cycle → ~8-9 rules (maintenance)
... continues cycling between 8-12 rules
```

### Three Phases of Rule Evolution

**Phase 1: Exploration (Tasks 1-50)**
- High rate of new rule creation
- Diverse rule types and strategies
- Some rules prove ineffective and get removed

**Phase 2: Optimization (Tasks 51-200)**
- Focus shifts to rule refinement
- Merging eliminates redundancy
- Rule quality steadily improves

**Phase 3: Maintenance (Tasks 200+)**
- Stable set of high-quality rules
- Occasional new rules for novel situations
- Continuous fine-tuning of existing rules

## Rule Generation Rate Analysis

### HotpotQA Statistics

Based on 20 rules generated:

**Generation Efficiency:**
- **~2.5 rules per cycle** average (20 rules ÷ 8 cycles)
- **Every 5 tasks** triggers generation
- **40+ total tasks** minimum to reach 20 rules

**Quality Indicators:**
- **High diversity**: 20 distinct rules suggests rich pattern space
- **Domain complexity**: HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning creates varied scenarios
- **Effective extraction**: System successfully identified actionable patterns

### Factors Affecting Generation Rate

**Task Complexity:**
- More complex tasks → more diverse failure modes → more rules
- Multi-step reasoning → multiple rule categories
- Question-answering domain → specialized strategies

**Failure Rate:**
- Higher failure rate → more comparative analysis opportunities
- Failed examples provide contrast for rule generation
- Balanced success/failure ratio optimal for learning

**Task Variety:**
- Different question types → different rule categories
- Varied reasoning patterns → diverse strategic insights
- Domain-specific challenges → specialized rules

### 3. Domain Adaptation
Rule generation adapts to domain complexity:
- **Simple domains**: 5-10 stable rules
- **Complex domains** (like HotpotQA): 15-25 diverse rules
- **Specialized domains**: Custom rule categories emerge

### 4. Temporal Evolution
Rule sets evolve through distinct phases:
- **Exploration**: Rapid rule creation and testing

### 5. Configuration Flexibility
System behavior can be tuned for different scenarios:
- Memory limits adjust rule capacity
- Generation frequency controls learning rate
- Merging intervals balance exploration vs exploitation

The G-Memory system represents a sophisticated approach to continuous learning that balances exploration of new strategies with exploitation of proven patterns, resulting in adaptive rule sets that improve system performance over time.
